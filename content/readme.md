# Introduction

## Making a new crypto portal

The old page here was just a personal card purposed to act as a cryptocurrency portal. Technically works, but not an ideal solution.

Thus, I now announce a new site that does its stuff more properly. However, this takes some work so it isn't exactly up already. In the meanwhile, you can access the old version [here](/old).

Alternatively, check out the sidebar for parts that might be complete already. This page will be the last to finish, after all. (Hint: The folders with capitalised first letter are going to be the permanent parts.)
