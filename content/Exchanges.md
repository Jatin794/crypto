So you have some money (or crypto) and now you want to frivoslously play around with it. Very well, look no further. Here I list exchanges sorted by their country of origin in no particular order; in the linked page you can see some recommended details.

Update: Added recommended coins to use for withdrawal, especially if you, like me, use multiple exchanges and prefer low fees in transferring between them. Or if you want a not-expensive crypto exit strategy.

Update 2: Added brief reliability reviews for the exchanges I've used often enough. Seems it should be helpful in deciding for when you want to choose just a few exchanges.
