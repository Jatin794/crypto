Indian exchange, currently owned by Binance. Somewhat unreliable due to ratelimits.

Recommended coins for withdrawal: XLM - 0.05XLM/About 3 cents - Alternatively, free USDT transfer to Binance

Reliability - Tier 2. Gave me ratelimits on just opening the site and server errors (a volatile trading website should never do that), but deposits and withdrawals have worked well by experience for small volumes.
