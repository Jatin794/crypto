For my crypto. subdomain

Was originally hosted at https://jatinnagpal.hns.to/, but that's been getting slower and even unreliable at times. Thus, this repo can now be directly served from a CDN for maximal efficiency. The old index is still kept as oldindex.html and oldindex2.html for historical purposes only - they're likely to outdate soon or already by the time you're reading this. However, the change is gonna be well worth it.

Update #2:
The old index no longer really matters. Finally, as planned, I'm switching the upstream to locally - The oldindex files still contain how it used to be when I made it using a personal card maker. Try visiting https://crypto.jatinnagpal.com/old for a real preview.
Now it's made using a cool new wiki starter for gatsby, as you can see from the fork details.
